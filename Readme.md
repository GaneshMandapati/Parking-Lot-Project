<h1>Parking Lot Project</h1>

This is a C++ project which uses Priority queue that are implemented using Min Heap in a parking lot project.

Whenever we go to a mall or any other place, we always want that we should get a vacant parking slot which is nearest to the lift so that if we have to put some groceries in our car or other stuff in the car, we can easily put it and so that we have to walk less.

So in this project, a parking lot is imitated.

First user is asked to enter the dimensions of the parking lot and then the user enters the co-ordinates of where the lift is.

Then the distances of all the vacant slots are put in a Priority Queue which is implemented using a Min Heap. Whenever a car enter or exits, the queue is updated, so that the next passenger gets the nearest vacant slot to the lift.

So this is the Parking Lot Project and this is how we have used Priority Queue and Min Heap.
